            <h2>How to get to the venue</h2>

            <h3>3 main options for getting to the closest city: Perugia</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Train from within Europe</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you intend to fly into Rome or Florence you can easily catch a train that gets you to Perugia.
                        Prices of trains are relatively cheap and the travel time is approximately 2 hours from the mentioned cities, with a possible change, so look out for that when booking these train tickets. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Drive from within Europe</h4>
                    <p>
                        We are aware that some people attending will be driving and it is obviously very possible to drive from wherever you are in Europe to Perugia.
                        The venue itself has a parking lot at the front in which you can leave the car when you are not using it. 
                        Pease be aware that the vast majority of cars in Europe are manual and the venue is on a pretty steep mountain.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Fly into Perugia</h4>
                    <p>
                        Perugia has a an airport, albeit small. So you will not be able to get a direct flight in. If you intend to fly in directly from Montreal, I suggest looking at getting a connecting flight from London because flights from London are the cheapest option by plane.
                        You can fly to Rome and take a train, or there may even be a flight from Rome, but it will depend on flight paths at the time. Please check your options, but a connecting flight into Perugia is certainly possible.
